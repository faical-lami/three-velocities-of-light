Abstract

This note  clarifies a fundamental but often overlooked distinction in optics and wave physics: the difference between the energy velocity, signal-front velocity, and pattern velocity of light. Using a classical mechanical analogy — a rolling wheel whose top point moves faster than the hub — it is shown how geometric effects can produce velocities that differ from the system’s translational speed. By analyzing a rotating laser beam, it is demonstrated that pattern points (e.g., a light spot) can exhibit effective velocities exceeding the speed of light c, without violating relativity. The result is a necessary conceptual separation between three distinct entities: energy transport, causality, and geometric pattern. This distinction provides a more precise vocabulary for describing electromagnetic fields and resolves common misunderstandings about superluminal phenomena.

 

 

Keywords**:** speed of light; energy velocity; signal front; pattern velocity; superluminal motion; wave optics; field geometry.

1. Introduction

Although the speed of light c is one of the most fundamental constants in physics, a single number conceals three distinct phenomena that are often treated as identical. In many texts, terms such as “wavefront,” “signal,” “light pulse,” “pattern,” and “energy” are used interchangeably, as if referring to the same dynamical entity. This linguistic conflation leads to logical contradictions, especially in discussions of superluminal effects.

In physical literature, the speed of light in vacuum is usually presented as a singular constant: c. This is correct and necessary when referring to the transport of energy or causal information. However, in many contexts, light does not appear as a point-like particle, but as a field with extension, shape, and internal reference points. In such cases, different parts of the same physical system can exhibit different effective velocities.

A similar phenomenon is well known in classical mechanics, where the distinction between translational velocity and instantaneous point velocity is uncontroversial. In light fields, the center, signal front, and pattern should likewise be treated as distinct entities. Conflating them leads to unnecessary paradoxes, whereas a clear separation shows that geometric velocities v

> c are a natural consequence of the field’s form.



The mechanical analogy of a rolling wheel illustrates this clearly: the hub moves at the car’s speed, while the top of the tire has an instantaneous velocity twice as large. Light exhibits a similar structure, but the absence of an established tripartite vocabulary — energy, front, pattern — causes fast-geometry phenomena to be misinterpreted as attempts to violate relativity, even though they fully obey physical laws.

When physicists say “the wavefront moves at c,” they refer to the signal front, not the geometric form of the field. But when they demonstrate a laser spot sweeping across a surface at v ≫ c (for example, 10c), they are referring to the pattern front. These two motions are entirely different, yet the same word — “front” — is often used for both. It is this conflation that creates most apparent superluminal paradoxes.

The purpose of this note  is to establish a simple and strict division between three concepts — energy velocity, signal-front velocity, and pattern velocity — which together provide a complete and contradiction-free description of light’s dynamics. By formulating this distinction explicitly, several well-known misunderstandings are resolved, and superluminal phenomena appear as entirely natural consequences of field geometry.

2. The Mechanical Analogy: The Wheel

To understand how part of a system can move faster than the system itself, consider a wheel rolling without slipping. The car (and the wheel’s hub) moves forward with velocity v.

The wheel’s motion is a superposition of two components:

Translation forward with velocity v.

Rotation about the hub with peripheral velocity v (since v = Rω for rolling without slipping).


This gives rise to three distinct instantaneous velocities for different points on the wheel:

The hub: moves with v.

The contact point with the ground: moves with v – v = 0 (instantaneously at rest).

The top point of the tire: moves with v + v = 2v.


The fact that the top of the tire moves at double the car’s speed is not a violation of mechanics, but a direct geometric consequence. The key point is this: a geometric point in a system can exhibit a velocity exceeding the system’s “intrinsic” speed without violating its fundamental constraints.

3. The Optical Proof: The Superluminal Laser Spot

The same logic applies to light. Consider a laser rotating with constant angular velocity ω and projecting a beam onto a wall at distance L.

Each individual photon leaving the laser travels radially outward toward the wall at speed c. No energy moves sideways. But the point where the beam strikes the wall — the light spot — slides along the wall’s surface.

For small angles, the spot’s position x(t) is:

x(t) ≈ L · ωt

The spot’s velocity v_spot is the time derivative:

v_spot = dx/dt = L · ω

If the distance L is sufficiently large, or the angular velocity ω sufficiently high, the product Lω exceeds c.

Example: If L = 3 · 10⁹ meters (≈ 10 light-seconds) and ω = 1 rad/s, the spot’s velocity is 10c.


This is a standard effect in physics. No photon moves at 10c. No information travels from one side of the wall to the other via the spot (since each point on the wall is hit by new photons from the source). But the pattern — the geometric position of the intensity maximum — moves superluminally.

Here, the analogy with the wheel is complete:

The photon (hub): bound to the system’s base velocity (c, or v for the car).

The pattern (top point): a geometric product allowed to move faster (> c, or > 2v).


It should be noted that this effect does not occur in a pure spherical wave from a point source in vacuum, where both the energy center and signal front travel exactly at c. Superluminal pattern velocities require an additional geometric component — such as rotation, interference, or projection — combined with light’s intrinsic motion, just as the wheel’s top velocity requires both translation and rotation.

4. Three Velocities in Light Fields

To avoid conceptual confusion, a strict separation of velocity concepts in electromagnetic fields is required. We identify three levels:

A. Energy Velocity (Center)

This is the velocity of the energy center of the wave packet. In vacuum, this is always c. It corresponds to the transport of the physical quantity (photons).

B. Signal-Front Velocity (Causality)

This defines the velocity of the absolute first, non-zero change in the field (the front). According to relativity, no cause–effect relationship can propagate faster than c. The front sets the upper limit for when a detector can begin to respond.

C. Pattern Velocity (Geometry)

This is the velocity of a form or specific state in the field, such as an interference fringe, intensity peak, node, or projected spot. These entities carry no mass of their own and transport no energy in their direction of motion. Therefore, pattern velocity is not limited by c.

5. Discussion: Information vs. Geometry

A common counterargument is that “information cannot travel faster than light.” This is correct if information is strictly defined as causality (a signal that can trigger a bomb or send a message).

In the laser-spot case, an observer at point A on the wall cannot send a message to point B via the spot, because the spot is controlled from the source. The spot’s arrival at B is not caused by its arrival at A, but by the laser’s rotation. These are correlated events, not causal ones.

However, it is clear that geometric information (where the pattern is located) can change at velocities > c. By distinguishing causal information from geometric form, the paradox dissolves. Physics allows forms to move freely, while energy and causality remain strictly bounded.

6. Conclusion

The dynamics of light are richer than the single constant c. By applying the same geometric principles used for a rolling wheel, it becomes evident that pattern velocities in optical fields can exceed the speed of light without violating relativity.

A correct analysis of light therefore requires distinguishing between:

Energy transport (c)

Signal front (c)

Pattern geometry (arbitrary velocity)


This taxonomy provides a clearer and more physically stringent description of wave propagation and eliminates the mystique surrounding superluminal geometric phenomena.

 

 

 

 **** 

Denna kompletterande sektion är inte en del av huvudargumentet, men fördjupar den geometriska intuitionen bakom superluminala mönsterhastigheter. Syftet är att visa att även inom en enskild vågpacketstruktur kan interna fältmarkörer röra sig snabbare än energicentrumet, på samma sätt som en punkt på ett rullande hjul kan uppvisa en momentan hastighet som överstiger hjulets translationshastighet. Genom att formulera detta explicit blir det tydligt hur ett ljusfälts interna fasgeometri skapar tillåtna superluminala mönster utan att överföra energi eller bryta relativiteten.

 

7. Internal Phase Geometry in Light Fields

Although the three-velocity framework (energy, signal front, pattern) is sufficient to resolve all apparent superluminal paradoxes, there is one further perspective that strengthens the conceptual picture: the geometric behavior of the internal phase of a propagating electromagnetic wave.

This supplement clarifies how an internal oscillation of the field — the phase rhythm inside the wave packet — can exhibit forward motion relative to the packet’s center, without implying superluminal energy transport. It connects directly back to the mechanical wheel analogy, showing that even within a single object, certain internal markers can move faster than the object’s overall translation.

7.1. The Field as a Volume: A 3D Entity, Not a 1D Line

A photon or wave packet is often drawn as a 1D sinusoid. However, physically, the electromagnetic disturbance occupies a finite 3D volume as it travels. Within that volume, the electric and magnetic fields oscillate in a coordinated pattern:

compression–expansion in amplitude

rotation in polarization

phase evolution along the direction of travel


This internal activity is not “beside” the photon — it is inside it. Therefore, any internal forward-moving pattern exists within the packet’s spatial region, just as points on a rolling wheel exist within the wheel’s structure.

This distinction is essential.

7.2. Internal Phase Motion vs. Packet Motion

Let the photon’s packet center move at c (as required by relativity). Let the internal phase of the electromagnetic field be represented as:

Φ(x,t) = kx – ωt

The motion of a point of constant phase Φ = constant is:

v_phase = ω / k

In many media, and even in vacuum for highly structured fields, v_phase can exceed c. This is not only allowed — it is expected.

Importantly:

the packet (energy center) moves at c

the signal front moves at c

but the internal phase point moves at v_phase > c


The internal phase velocity,

V_phase = ω / k,

Can exceed c. This is not only allowed — it is a geometric consequence of the field structure itself.

 

Crucially, even though the energy center of the wave packet and its signal front move strictly at c, the internal phase marker can advance through the packet’s field volume with an effective speed v_phase > c relative to the packet’s center.

 

This superluminal behaviour reflects the packet’s internal geometry, not any form of energy or information transport.

7.3. Connecting the Wheel Analogy to the Photon Interior

The rolling wheel has:

a hub speed (v)

a top point at (2v)

a bottom point at (0)


The key feature is that the top point’s 2v is neither an object nor an independent entity; it is a geometric marker inside the wheel’s rotation.

Likewise, a propagating photon or wave packet has:

energy transport at c

signal front at c

internal phase points moving faster than c


These internal points do not outrun the photon; they move through the photon’s volume just as the top point moves over the wheel’s surface.

The analogy is exact:

Car speed ↔ packet energy speed (c)

Top point ↔ internal forward phase (v_phase > c)

No violation of relativity ↔ no violation of mechanics


7.4. Why This Matters for Superluminal Claims

Many conceptual misunderstandings arise when internal markers are mistaken for transport of physical quantities. By clearly separating:

1. energy velocity


2. signal-front velocity


3. pattern / internal-phase velocity



it becomes evident that:

superluminal pattern motions are geometric

superluminal phase motions are geometric

only energy and causality are constrained to c


This unified view shows that superluminal behavior is not exotic — it is simply the geometry of wave fields.

7.5. Summary of the Internal-Phase Principle

Internal phase motion inside a photon behaves exactly like the over-speeding point on a rolling wheel:

it is internal

it is geometric

it carries no energy

it is allowed to exceed c

it does not imply faster-than-light communication

it does not break relativity


This supplement therefore extends the main text’s framework and shows that superluminal internal dynamics in light are not only possible, but natural consequences of field geometry.

Figure 1. Internal phase motion and the rolling-wheel analogue. The illustration shows two parallel structures:

(1) Left: A wheel rolling without slipping. Three points are marked: – the hub (velocity v), – the contact point (instantaneously at rest), – the top point (instantaneous velocity 2v).

The over-velocity of the top point does not arise from any decoupling, but from the fact that the wheel’s rotation is added on top of the wheel’s translation. This exemplifies how an internal geometric marker can move faster than the center of the system.

(2) Right: A schematic electromagnetic wave packet (the photon visualized as a three-dimensional field volume). Three levels are indicated: – the wave packet center moving at c, – the signal front also moving at c, – an internal phase marker (a point of constant phase Φ = constant) moving forward through the packet with a velocity v_phase > c.

The over-velocity of the phase marker is represented as a slanted line that crosses the interior of the packet faster than the packet itself propagates. This internal motion carries no energy and can therefore be superluminal without transferring information or violating relativity. The figure shows that both the top point of the wheel and the internal phase of the wave field share the same geometric principle: an internal marker can have a higher velocity than the system that contains it.

Appendix A: Formal background for pattern velocity and geometric phase in light fields

This appendix summarizes the mathematical and geometric basis that explains how a pattern point in a light field can exhibit an effective velocity greater than c, without energy or causal influence violating the constraints of relativity.

A.1 Basic field picture

We consider an electromagnetic field in vacuum with a local phase φ(x, t).

The internal structure of a propagating electromagnetic wavepacket possesses its own coordinate system, within which phase markers can move independently of the packet’s translational motion.

For a plane-wave segment, the field is written as:

E(x, t) = E₀ · cos(kx − ωt + φ₀)

where k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ₀ is an internal phase (local offset).

At a given point in space:

the forward propagation of the phase is governed by k and ω,

the center of energy follows the group velocity v_g = c,

the very first change in the field follows the signal front v_front = c.


The phase information φ(x, t), by contrast, is a geometric function, not an energy carrier.

A.2 Pattern velocity as geometric derivative

Assume a pattern is defined by a phase level:

φ(x, t) = constant

Implicit differentiation gives the pattern velocity:

dφ = (∂φ/∂x) dx + (∂φ/∂t) dt = 0

⇒ dx/dt = − (∂φ/∂t) / (∂φ/∂x)

This dx/dt is the pattern velocity v_pattern.

The key point is:

∂φ/∂x can become extremely small,

∂φ/∂t can be very large (for example due to rotation).


When the denominator tends to zero, the quotient blows up:

v_pattern → much greater than c

No energy is required to move sideways. Only the pattern itself shifts.

A.3 Rotational geometry (laser example)

For a rotating laser, the position of the spot on a wall is given by:

x(t) ≈ L · θ(t) = L · ωt

The derivative is:

v_spot = dx/dt = L · ω

Since v_spot has no physical carrier (it is only a geometric point), its magnitude can take any value – including v_spot > c.

A.4 Physical consistency

Energy center → moves at c Signal front → also moves at c Pattern geometry → defined by the structure of the phase information, has no upper bound

A superluminal pattern velocity is therefore a pure field effect, not a violation of relativity.

A.5 Geometric phase as an internal coordinate

Inside a wave packet, the phase varies continuously. For a pulsed light packet, we can write:

φ_internal(t) = ω_internal · t

If the wave packet has a spatial extent Δx, different parts of the packet will have different phase angles at each instant. This implies:

the internal phase “rotates” faster than the packet center moves,

this is an internal dynamics, not an external displacement,

a point on the front of the packet can therefore change phase faster than the packet itself moves forward.


Mathematical consequence:

v_internal_pattern = Δx · ω_internal

This velocity can exceed c without violating physics, because it is an internal coordination, not external energy transport.

 

Volume Principle (Proposed Geometric Synthesis)

The Volume Principle (Proposed Geometric Synthesis)

In physical systems that possess both translational motion and internal geometric structure, certain internally defined points may exhibit effective velocities that exceed the system’s own translational speed. Such behavior arises when the motion is generated solely by the system’s internal geometry—rotation, phase evolution, interference structure, or field configuration—and remains confined within the system’s spatial extent.

This phenomenon appears across multiple established domains of physics:

In a rolling wheel, the top point attains 2v while the hub moves at v.

In a rotating laser beam, the projected spot may move at v ≫ c while every photon travels strictly at c.

In structured electromagnetic wave packets, internal phase markers or intensity features can shift through the packet’s field volume at effective speeds exceeding c, even in vacuum.


In all such cases, the superluminal or super-translational motion belongs to a geometric marker, not to the transport of energy, information, or causal influence. The system’s center of energy and its signal front remain strictly bound by the fundamental physical speed limits.

This repeated structural pattern motivates the following formulation:

A marker defined purely by the internal, non-translational geometry of a finite physical system — such as rotation, phase evolution, or interference structure — may exhibit a momentary velocity greater than the system’s external translational speed, provided this motion remains confined within the system’s spatial region and carries no energy or causal signal.

The Volume Principle does not propose new physics. Instead, it synthesizes a set of long-recognized but rarely unified observations across classical mechanics, optics, and wave theory. It highlights a geometric degrees-of-freedom that already exist in standard physics, but which are typically discussed only in isolated contexts.

 

 **** 

Volume Principle — Formal List (v1.0)

These statements summarize the internal logic of the Volume Principle. They are not physical “laws” in the fundamental sense, but formal conditions that follow from the principle’s geometric structure.

1. Volume as a Local Space A physical system with finite spatial extent constitutes its own local volume. All internal dynamics occur within this volume, independent of the system’s translation through external space.

2. Internal Motion Defined by Internal Geometry Phase shifts, internal markers, rotational points, interference structures, and all geometry-dependent features count as internal coordinates as long as they remain within the system’s volume.

3. Internal Coordinates Do Not Obey External Speed Limits The motion of an internal coordinate is constrained solely by the system’s internal geometry and is not bounded by the system’s external translational velocity (for example, c in electromagnetic field systems).

4. Internal Super-Velocity Is Physically Allowed An internal marker may reach a momentary velocity greater than the system’s translation without transporting energy, information, or causal influence. Such motion is fully compatible with relativity.

5. Generality This principle applies to all structured systems, including but not limited to: – rotating wheels – electromagnetic wave packets – the 3D field volume of a photon – interference patterns – any system with internal geometry

6. No External Transfer Occurs Internal super-velocity cannot be used for communication, energy transfer, or causal interaction outside the system’s volume.

7. External Velocity Remains Limited The system’s translational motion through external space remains bounded by external constraints (e.g., the relativistic speed limit c for photons and wave packets).

 

Mathematical Note

Let the system’s center follow X(t), with external speed v_external = dX/dt.

Let an internal marker satisfy a geometric constraint:

F(x, t) = constant

Implicit differentiation gives:

dx/dt = − (∂F/∂t) / (∂F/∂x)

If ∂F/∂x becomes small while ∂F/∂t remains finite, then:

|dx/dt| → arbitrarily large

This velocity is internal, does not transport energy, and does not affect:

v_external ≤ c.

Therefore:

internal velocity can exceed external velocity without violating relativity.

 

Clarification: Wave-Packet Volume in Standard Optics

In modern quantum optics, a “photon” is typically represented as a localized wave packet: a finite region of the electromagnetic field where amplitude, phase, and energy are concentrated. This region behaves as an effective spatial volume. Any internal motion — phase markers, pattern shifts, front-region deformation — occurs within this field volume and is therefore classified as internal dynamics of the wave packet, not external energy transport. This is the sense in which the Volume Principle refers to a “photon’s field volume”.

Physical Justification for the Term “Photon Volume”

Although a photon in quantum field theory is not a classical particle with a sharp boundary, every propagating electromagnetic excitation occupies a finite region of significant field amplitude. This region is not a rigid container but a localized structure of the continuous electromagnetic field.

In wave-packet descriptions — the framework used in quantum optics, ultrafast optics, and photonic engineering — this localized region behaves operationally like a volume:

it has spatial extent,

it has a front and a tail,

it contains an internal phase rhythm,

and it supports geometric patterns that evolve during propagation.


Referring to this region as a photon volume is therefore physically legitimate. The term does not imply a classical surface or a mechanical object, but simply denotes the local field region within which the photon’s energy and phase structure are concentrated.

All internal geometric motions discussed in this work — including phase advancement exceeding the packet’s translational speed — occur within this field volume. This justifies treating the photon’s localized wave-packet region as a volume when analyzing internal velocities and the geometric foundations of the Volume Principle.

Supplement 1 — Figure 2: Superluminal Laser Spot (v_spot = Lω)

Figure 2. Geometric origin of a superluminal laser spot. The illustration shows a laser placed at the origin, rotating with constant angular velocity ω and projecting a beam onto a distant planar surface. The beam’s impact point on the surface is shown as a light spot whose position for small angles is given by x(t) ≈ L · ωt.

The spot moves along the surface with speed

v_spot = L · ω.

The figure includes two lines: – a vertical line marking the wall at distance L, – a sweeping beam rotating across the wall.

The spot position is marked at three times (t₁, t₂, t₃), and the distance between them grows linearly with time. In the illustration, L is chosen so large that v_spot is superluminal. No energy moves sideways; each point on the wall receives photons directly from the source. The figure clarifies that the superluminal velocity belongs to the pattern, not to the photons, analogous to how the top point of the wheel moves faster than the hub without any part of the wheel leaving the system.

Supplement 2 — Figure 3: Three Velocities in a Single Light Field

Figure 3. Three independent velocities in a propagating light field. The graph shows three distinct curves along the same propagation direction:

1. Signal front Represented as a straight line with slope corresponding to exactly c. It marks the first non-zero change in the field. This is always strictly constrained by the relativistic speed limit.


2. Energy center Represented as a second line with the same slope c, but slightly shifted in time. This is the maximum of the wave packet’s energy, i.e. the center of energy. Energy transport is likewise strictly limited to c.


3. Pattern front Represented as a more steeply sloped line than the other two, corresponding to a velocity greater than c. This line can represent, for example, an intensity peak, an interference fringe, or a phase marker.



The figure clearly displays the separation: – signal front and energy center must move at c, – the pattern front can have any speed.

It is this separation that resolves common paradoxes: a form can be superluminal without any physical substance travelling faster than light.

Supplement 3 — Historical Notes: Why This Distinction Was Never Explicit

Supplement 3. Historical notes: conceptual blind spots in 20th-century wave physics. This short historical comment explains why 20th-century physics never established a formal three-part vocabulary for the velocities of light, even though the phenomena were known.

1. Maxwell’s theory already gave a simple picture: For electromagnetic waves in vacuum, both the signal front and the energy center move exactly at c. This became such a strong axiom that the need for an additional category was never considered necessary.


2. Superluminal patterns were treated as pedagogical, not physical: Phenomena such as laser spots moving faster than c were often used as lecture examples, but regarded as “geometric tricks” rather than a separate category with physical status.


3. The language solidified: The term “front” was used both for the signal front and for various pattern fronts, even though they are entirely different entities. This linguistic legacy has persisted in the literature without a formal separation of the concepts.


4. No demand for precision until recently: Modern optical systems (fast scanners, femtosecond lasers, phase shaping, spatial modulation) make pattern velocities relevant in practical applications. This has made the need for a clear taxonomy greater than before.



Supplement 4 — Formal Derivation: Phase Surfaces, Group Motion & Pattern Velocity

Supplement 4. Formal derivation of superluminal pattern velocity using standard wave theory. This supplement shows mathematically how pattern velocities > c arise within established wave theory, without new assumptions. The derivation uses fully standard concepts: phase surfaces, group velocity, and coordinate geometry.

4.1 Phase surfaces in a plane-wave field

An electromagnetic wave in vacuum can be written as

E(x, t) = E₀ · cos(kx − ωt)

where – k = wave number, – ω = angular frequency, – ω/k = c in vacuum.

A phase surface is defined by the condition kx − ωt = constant. Solution:

x(t) = (ω / k) t = c · t

The phase velocity is thus exactly c. This is the base velocity of “what the wave is”.

4.2 Group center in a wave packet

A wave packet built from a narrow spectrum around k₀ has its center at

x_group(t) = v_g · t v_g = dω/dk

In vacuum, dω/dk = c, so the group’s energy center also moves at c.

This is the base velocity of “what the wave carries”.

4.3 Geometric patterns: projection + motion

Now consider a light beam defining a direction

r(t) = (cos θ(t), sin θ(t))

and hitting a surface at distance L in the x-direction.

The spot position on the wall is:

x_spot(t) = L · tan θ(t)

For small angles, tan θ ≈ θ:

x_spot(t) ≈ L · θ(t)

Assume a rotation θ(t) = ωt:

x_spot(t) = Lωt v_spot = dx_spot/dt = Lω

This is the pattern velocity, and it can satisfy:

v_spot > c v_spot » c v_spot → ∞ (in the limit L → ∞)

4.4 Why this is allowed

No phase, no group, no energy, and no signal travels with speed Lω. It is only the solution of the geometry that does so.

Neither Maxwell’s equations, relativity, nor quantum theory are violated.

This supplement shows mathematically:

Pattern → arbitrary speed Phase → c Group → c

Supplement 5 — 3D Visualization: Structure of a Moving Light Packet

Supplement 5. 3D conceptual visualization of a propagating photon-like energy packet. This supplement provides a visualization of how a three-dimensional light packet can be understood geometrically within completely standard physics, without assigning any internal mechanical structure to the photon.

5.1 Basic picture: a wave bubble

In 3D, a free photon in quantum field theory represents an excitation center of the electromagnetic field. It can be visualized as:

– a locally peaked field amplitude, – moving at c, – oscillating transversely.

5.2 Internal oscillation (field phase)

The internal phase variation in the packet – E(x, t) and B(x, t) alternating in orthogonal planes – is a real dynamics of the field. It takes place at frequency ν = ω / 2π, where ω can be enormous (e.g. 10¹⁵ s⁻¹).

This activity:

– propagates at c along the direction r, – but its local phase surfaces can be tilted “forward”, – and these phase surfaces can have an internal direction lying ahead of the energy center.

This leads to the fact that

phase-related markers in the front region can have an effective motion faster than the packet’s energy center,

but only within the field volume – never as energy in space.

5.3 Geometric front region

The front half of the packet volume contains:

– phase surfaces, – interference patterns, – intensity gradients, – polarization structures.

All of these are geometric objects in the field.

As the packet moves at speed c, these structures can:

– shift slightly forward, – orient in particular directions, – drive a pattern further ahead than the energy center,

and thereby give rise to something that, in a certain sense, can be described as:

“internal motion in the packet pointing forward”

But it is never cause, never energy, never transport. It is a geometric deformation.

5.4 Summary of the 3D picture

This supplement establishes:

1. energy → moves at c,


2. phase surfaces → move at c, but can be oriented forward,


3. patterns in the front region → can have effective speeds > c,


4. nothing violates relativity.



Supplement 6 — Common Misconceptions: Phase Velocity, Group Velocity & Apparent Superluminality

Supplement 6. Distinguishing pattern velocity from phase velocity and group velocity in standard electromagnetism.

Superluminal phenomena are often confused with phase or group velocity in wave theory. This supplement clarifies why your pattern velocity belongs to a different category, and why it is strictly allowed even in the most conservative version of physics.

6.1 Phase velocity: always ≥ c, but not physical transport

In a dispersive wave, we have:

v_phase = ω / k

In vacuum this gives:

v_phase = c (always exactly c)

In dispersive media, v_phase can exceed c, but this is not considered a violation of relativity because:

– the phase carries no energy, – the phase carries no information, – a pure phase solution is a mathematical period, not a physical object point.

Physicists know that the phase can be faster than c without problems.

6.2 Group velocity: exactly c in vacuum

In a non-dispersive medium:

v_group = dω/dk = c

This is the speed of the energy center, and it is the speed relevant for all causality.

6.3 Why your pattern velocity ≠ phase velocity

What you are describing is not:

– a moving phase period, – a group-center motion, – or a solution of Maxwell’s equations with modified dispersion,

but rather a geometric projection in space.

The laser spot is not a phase surface. It is not a group function either. It is a physical point defined by wheel-like geometry:

x_spot(t) = L · tan(ωt)

This belongs to a third category for which physicists lack a well-established formal language, but which is fully legitimate:

pattern velocity = the speed of a spatially defined maximum → a purely geometric object.

6.4 Why this supplement matters

It shows that you are not “reinventing” phase velocity. You are making precise a phenomenon that already occurs but has rarely been clearly articulated:

superluminal geometry is not the same as superluminal wave transport.

Supplement 7 — Mathematical Upper Bound: Why Pattern Velocity Has No Limit

Supplement 7. Formal demonstration that pattern velocity has no theoretical upper bound.

Here we derive why pattern velocity has no upper limit according to Maxwell’s equations, relativity, or wave theory.

7.1 The role of geometry

We start from:

x_spot(t) = L · tan(θ(t))

For small angles:

x_spot(t) ≈ L · θ(t) θ(t) = ωt

Then:

x_spot(t) = Lωt v_spot = Lω

7.2 Parameters that can be varied freely

(1) Distance L There is no upper bound in physics for how far away a wall can be.

L → ∞ ⇒ v_spot → ∞

(2) Angular velocity ω There is no fundamental upper bound on the rotation rate of a light beam (practical limits exist, but not theoretical ones).

ω → ∞ ⇒ v_spot → ∞

(3) Combination For any (L, ω) such that Lω > c:

v_spot > c

For any (L, ω) such that Lω » c:

v_spot » c

For any (L, ω) such that Lω → ∞:

v_spot → ∞

7.3 Why relativity is unaffected

Einstein’s limit applies to:

– energy transport, – signal transport, – cause–effect chains.

It does not apply to:

– coordinate geometry, – pattern maxima, – projected points, – solutions of trigonometric geometry.

Therefore, no upper bound exists here.

7.4 Conclusion

Pattern velocity has no theoretical upper bound. As long as:

– no energy is transported in the direction of motion, – no information follows the pattern, – no causal chain runs through the point,

the velocities v_spot, v_pattern and other geometry-based speeds are entirely free from the c-limit.

Supplement 8 — Modern Applications: Where This Distinction Matters in Real Physics

Supplement 8. Real scientific contexts where pattern, front, and energy speeds differ in practice.

This supplement shows that the three-way distinction is not an academic exercise – it is directly relevant to modern research.

8.1 LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory)

In LIGO’s interferometers:

– the energy in the light moves at c, – the front moves exactly at c, – the interference pattern moves with arbitrary speed.

When the mirrors vibrate at the atomic level, the interference pattern can shift across the detector surface at speeds vastly greater than c.

8.2 Spatial Light Modulators (SLM) and holographic displays

When a phase modulator changes a local phase, this implies:

– no energy moving sideways, – but extremely rapid displacements of pattern maxima.

The pattern velocity can become millions of times c.

8.3 Rotating mirrors in optical laboratories

The classical experimental geometry you describe is used in:

– optical radar, – femtosecond diagnostics, – time-resolved mirror rotation, – pattern tracking.

8.4 Astrophysics: motion in pulsar patterns

When a pulsar’s light cone sweeps across the Earth, the “spot” moving across the sky has an effective superluminal speed.

8.5 Interference fringes in two-field setups

When two laser fields interfere, the fringe structure can sometimes move faster than c when the phases drift in time.

This is well known, but there is no established standard term for “pattern speed”.
