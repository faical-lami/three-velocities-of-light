Clarifies the distinction between energy, signal-front, and pattern velocities in light without violating relativity.



Three Velocities of Light: Energy, Signal Front, and Pattern Geometry

This repository contains a technical note that clarifies a common conceptual conflation in optics and wave physics: “the speed of light” refers to different physical entities depending on context.

The note distinguishes three separate notions of velocity in light fields:

Energy velocity: transport of energy (bounded by c in vacuum)

Signal-front velocity: causal onset of a disturbance (bounded by c)

Pattern velocity: motion of geometric features (e.g., projected spots, interference maxima), which can exceed c without transporting energy or causal influence


The superluminal cases discussed here are geometric and do not imply faster-than-light communication.

Note on the “Volume Principle”

The document includes a proposed geometric synthesis (“Volume Principle”) intended as a unifying way to describe internal/geometric marker motion across established examples (wheel analogy, rotating laser spot, structured field patterns). This is presented as a conceptual synthesis within standard physics, not as a claim of new fundamental laws.
